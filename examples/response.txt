<p>The plans are still murky and unconfirmed, but the outcry online was swift and categorical. <em>CNN</em> compiled a list of other Hollywood remakes <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/15/entertainment/matrix-reboot/">that it says â€œno one wanted.â€</a> And <em>Vanity Fair</em> took a similarly pithy approach, describing it as <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/03/the-matrix-remake-no-one-asked-for">â€œThe Matrix Remake No One Asked For.â€</a> This perspective seems to operate under the assumption that the film industry involves a democratic process in which moviegoers can cast their votes for where studiosâ€™ cash goes. If this were true, weâ€™d have more to fret about than a reboot of <em>The Matrix.</em></p>

                                        <p>The argument coming from naysayers of a <em>Matrix</em> reboot is very familiar: No one needs this, you can just watch the original, etc. Itâ€™s the same refrain we heard from <em>Star Wars</em> fans following the announcement of 2015â€™s <em>The Force Awakens</em>. People are generally resistant to change â€” and thatâ€™s normal, but it doesnâ€™t mean change shouldnâ€™t happen. <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/16/14938672/matrix-reboot-animatrix"><em>Polygon</em> pointed to</a> the animated <em>Matrix</em> spin-off, <em>The Animatrix</em>, as evidence of the potential in a new franchise. The series was part of an all-out marketing assault by Warner Bros. in the lead up to the release of the two <em>Matrix</em> sequels, but it was actually one of the better pieces of the franchise.</p>
                                        <p>What made audiences so obsessed with <em>The Matrix</em> was its prescience. Arriving at the height of Americaâ€™s consumerist transformation â€” and just two years before 9/11 altered the nationâ€™s politics and culture â€” <em>The Matrix</em> offered escapism in the form of an allegory. Maybe the world around us, with its assault of advertisements and logos, was a mere illusion and beneath the surface, humanityâ€™s collective soul yearned to break free â€” to take the red pill. A remake of the film certainly has big shoes to fill, but it is a welcome proposition: As authoritarian tendencies emerge around the world and the line between fact and fake is increasingly blurred, we could use some more of the radical foresight that the original <em>Matrix</em> offered.</p>
                                        <p>This isnâ€™t to say that any remake of <em>The Matrix</em> is certain to be a hit, just that it isnâ€™t useful to stay stuck in the past. I first watched <em>The Matrix</em> when it was released on DVD in 2003. I was 10 years old, and the film sparked a serious interest in technology. An entire generation of angsty kids could become obsessed with Neo, the Nebuchadnezzar, and the mindfulness they represented â€” in between seasons of <em>Mr. Robot</em> and <em>Black Mirror.</em> Itâ€™s been less than 20 years since its release, but the rapid technological advances of the past decade â€” and the increasingly, inescapably digital world we live in â€” make it feel all the more relevant. A reboot, as opposed to simply a remake, could offer room for incisive (and, yes, campy) analysis in the vein of the original film. At the very least, a series inspired by the movie could find its way to young people who likely need the eye-opening premise of the film now more than ever.</p>
